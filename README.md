# Building an Environment for Reproducible Computational Experiments in the Docker Container

**Docker** is a software tool to run applications in isolated environments with the help of containers. It is an open source containerization engine, which automates the packaging, shipping and deployment of any software applications that are presented as lightweight, portable and self-sufficient containers, that will run virtually anywhere.

A **Docker container** is a package filled with all the required libraries, dependencies, configuration files, scripts and operating system to run a software application independently. There can be numerous containers in a single machine and these containers are isolated from each other and from the host machine as well. There are sensible workarounds for running Docker service on different operating systems.

A **Docker image** is a set of instructions lined up to make a software application. Each change or commit that is made to the original image is stored in a separate layer. A docker image will have a base image on which additional modules can be attached. These images are typically read-only type.
